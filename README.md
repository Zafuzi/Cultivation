## Hunger

Slowly drains while doing any activity (even when idle). Combat, running, swimming, flying and even running drain this bar faster. Eat food to recover.

## Thirst

Slowly drains while doing any activity (even when idle). Combat, running, swimming, flying and even running drain this bar faster. Drink potions, water, beer, etc... to recover.

## Cultivation

Passively increases over time (slowly). Split into milestones, reaching the next milestone reduces the rates your hunger and thirst drain.

- Red Core (0%)
- Orange Core (-10%)
- Yellow Core (-20%)
- Green Core (-30%)
- Blue Core (-40%)
- Violet Core (-50%)
- White Core (-60%)

You can increase your cultivation faster by partaking in combat (3x) or by manually cultivating. Right now this is done by detecting the player riding a vehicle because there is no surefire way to detect a user sitting. If you have a better idea for this please let me know.

I currently use the Comfortable Pile of Pelts toy to simulate active cultivation
